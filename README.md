Project for CSE 332 - Data Structures and Parallelism

Wrote sequential code and using parallelism with ForkJoin framework and java threads, optimized the runtime. 

The data contained in the file "CenPop2010.txt" was published by the US Census Bureau. We imagine the entrie US as a giant rectangle
bounded by the minimum and maximum latitude/longitude of all the census-block-groups. The program works by taking parameters - west, south, east, north - 
coordinates of the query rectangle, then answers:
  - Population of the US:
  - Population of the rectangle:
  - percent of the total population:
